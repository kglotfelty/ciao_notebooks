# CIAO Notebooks

This is a collection of [CIAO](http://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao) notebooks
that I've written.

These are not offical products of the CXC, Chandra, or any of the other
various afflications you might want to consider.

Use at your own risk.


## Pretty Pictures

This notebook shows to to create nice 3-color images for Chandra observations
using several tools, scripts, and with witty and entertaining commentary
(or not).
